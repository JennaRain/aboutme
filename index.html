    <h1>A Little About Me</h1>
    <h2>Jenna Grimshaw</h2>
    <p>
      I am one of those <span>weird</span> people that absolutely
      <span>programming</span> and <span>statistics!</span>
      I have five years experience in R statistical analyses and then fell in
      love with Python three years ago. I just started playing with html,
      because I feel like I should be have my own professional website. I have
      been teaching graduate level Into to Python Programming course for a year
      now and I love that too.
